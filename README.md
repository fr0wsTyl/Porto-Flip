Teamwork repository for Telerik Academy team Porto Flip

We will create an online educational platform. 
The idea is that everyone could register as a teacher, 
create classes and teach and examine students via the platform. 
Users can choose wheather to sign up as students or teachers.
The platform will give them access to study resources of the courses they 
are signed up to.

Teacher  - create courses, add students, add resources
